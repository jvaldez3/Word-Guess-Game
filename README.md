# Word-Guess-Game
A Javascript hangman-type game

The purpose of this game is to simulate a hang-man type game where users can guess a random Harry Potter themed word.

When the page is loaded, it will prompt you to select any key to start game. The page will have selected a random word and the user will start guessing letters to try to find the correct. The user has up to 10 wrong guesses. Once these 10 wrong guesses have been used, the game will end and the user will be prompted that they have lost and ask if they would like to start the game over. If the user guesses the word before their guesses are out, they will win and be prompted so, and asked if they would like to play again. The win counter will add 1 to their score for each time they win.
